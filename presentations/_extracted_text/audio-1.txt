Motivation
● Knowledge distillation
● Make sure you apply it to good causes only, and understand the 
border impact of such technology.

Course Goals
● Create a positive and supportive environment where you can experiment, 
grow, and achieve accomplishments you can be proud of.
● “Observe” audio instead of “listen” to audio
● Be able to understand and implement relevant papers

Data-Driven Approach
Shifting from Expert Craftsmanship to Data-Driven Mastery: AI and Deep 
Learning Revolutionizing Solutions.
● Domain experts:
○ Hand craft the features / simulate physics to ‘learn’ statistical behaviour of the world
○ Rule-based models (in some cases really good ones -ASR, codecs, etc.)
● Data-driven
○ Clean data set + Computational power (expressive models) = good results
○ Reduce domain knowledge

And still, in real-world applications, engineering is a must.
● This is why this course will cover some classic methods
○ In many real world applications, there is not enough data to do ‘data driven’ 
approaches: low resources languages, applications where there is not enough data, 
etc.

● When one needs to be SoTA, the combination of classic and E2E methods 
sometimes outperforms each individual approach.

To deploy models that serves products, several factors must be achieved:
● On-cloud vs on-prem costs- Hi Siri, Alexa, etc. runs on edge

● Performances - Google didn’t replace their traditional ASR models for few years 
because their hand-crafted models outperformed the E2E models
● Explainability - regulations such as in healthcare, credit score (explainable AI hype).
● Safety

Cos/Sin with frequency of 10Hz has a wavelength of ~30 meters.
● Recall that the speed of sound is c=343 [m/s] 
● c[m/s]=𝜆[m]f[1/s]
● If we set f=10Hz; Hz=1/sec 
● 343[m/s]=𝜆[m]f[1/s] ->f = 10[1/s] →𝜆 = 34.3[m]

Basis of vector space
Each sample Si can be represented as a linear 
combination of the basis vectors.
In order to find alpha_i we PROJECT the sample over 
Vi
