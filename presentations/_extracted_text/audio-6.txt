● Finite Impulse Response - h[n] is finite
● FIR filters are always stable (by definition- all poles are at the origin, z=0)
● Also known as ‘moving average filters’ (MA), or ‘all zeros’ filters
● Pros:
○ Stable
○ Linear phase
○ Easy to implement and  construct using closed-form formulas
● Cons:
○ In order to get a sharp response, large order is required.
○ Larger delay compared to IIR

● Infinite Impulse Response - h[n] is infinite
● IIR filters iff all poles lie inside the unit circle
● Also known as ‘AutoRregressive Moving Average filters’ (ARMA)
● Pros:
○ Obtain sharper frequency response compared to same-order FIR filters 
(by moving the poles from origin)- lower computational complexity
○ Lower latency compared to FIR 
● Cons:
○ May cause phase issues
○ Harder to implement (no-close form in some cases). 
○ Overflow may be an issue due to recursiveness (infinite) of the response.

Classification of Signals
Signals can be classified in various ways as we saw in previous lectures: 
● Continuous vs discrete
● Periodic vs Aperiodic
We will now discuss on two classes:
● Probabilistic Vs Deterministic.

We will now discuss on two classes:
● Probabilistic Vs Deterministic.
● Stationary Vs. non-stationary.
Stationarity is a way of describing the characteristics of the signal generating process, which 
further gives us two categories.
The difference between stationary and non-stationary signals is that the statistical (joint probability 
distribution) properties of a stationary process signal do not change with time. Consequently, 
parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time.
Many time we use wide-sense stationarity (WSS) that implies that the mean and autocovariance do not 
change over time, while the second moment (variance) is finite

Stationary:
● White noise (probabilistic & stationary)
● Sin / cos (deterministic  & stationary)
Non-Stationary:
● Speech (probabilistic & non-stationary)

Energy & RMS
● Sometimes we want to represent some “trends” of signal, but its average has a (zero) constant 
value.
● 2 accepted measures for an ‘alternative’ average: RMS and Energy
○ RMS: Root-Mean-Squared. Most books define this as the “amount of AC power that produces the same 
heating effect as an equivalent DC power”
○ Energy:  defined as the area under the squared magnitude of the considered signal
● Usually calculated in chunks with hop.
